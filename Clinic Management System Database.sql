# 🏥 Clinic Management System Database

A comprehensive database management system designed for healthcare clinics to manage patients, appointments, medical records, billing, and staff operations efficiently.

## 📋 Project Description

The Clinic Management System is a full-featured relational database built with MySQL that handles all aspects of clinic operations. This system provides a robust foundation for managing:

- **Patient Management**: Complete patient profiles with medical history, contact information, and emergency contacts
- **Doctor & Staff Management**: Doctor specializations, credentials, and non-medical staff hierarchy
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Advanced booking system with conflict prevention and status tracking
- **Medical Records**: Comprehensive patient visit documentation with vital signs and diagnoses
- **Treatment & Prescription Management**: Treatment catalogs, medication inventory, and prescription tracking
- **Billing & Payments**: Automated billing, payment processing, and financial reporting
- **Inventory Management**: Medication stock tracking with automatic updates

### 🎯 Key Features

- **12 Interconnected Tables** with proper normalization
- **All Relationship Types**: One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many, and Self-Referencing
- **Comprehensive Constraints**: Primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, and data validation
- **Advanced Database Features**: Indexes, views, stored procedures, and triggers
- **Business Logic Implementation**: Automatic bill generation, inventory management, and scheduling conflicts prevention
- **Sample Data Included**: Ready-to-use test data for immediate demonstration

## 🛠️ How to Setup and Run

### Prerequisites
- MySQL Server 8.0 or later
- MySQL Workbench (recommended) or any MySQL client
- Administrative privileges to create databases

### Installation Steps

1. **Download the SQL File**
   ```
   Save the provided SQL script as: clinic_management_system.sql
   ```

2. **Open MySQL Client**
   - Launch MySQL Workbench or your preferred MySQL client
   - Connect to your MySQL server instance

3. **Execute the Script**
   ```sql
   -- Method 1: Using MySQL Workbench
   File → Open SQL Script → Select clinic_management_system.sql → Execute
   
   -- Method 2: Using Command Line
   mysql -u username -p < clinic_management_system.sql
   ```

4. **Verify Installation**
   ```sql
   SHOW DATABASES;
   USE ClinicManagement;
   SHOW TABLES;
   ```

### 🚀 Quick Start Commands

```sql
-- Switch to the database
USE ClinicManagement;

-- View all patients
SELECT * FROM Patients;

-- View appointment details with patient and doctor names
SELECT * FROM AppointmentDetails;

-- Check billing summary
SELECT * FROM BillingSummary;

-- Schedule a new appointment (using stored procedure)
CALL ScheduleAppointment(1, 1, '2025-08-25', '10:00:00', 'Regular checkup');
```

## 📊 Database Schema Overview

### Core Tables
| Table | Purpose | Key Relationships |
|-------|---------|------------------|
| `Patients` | Patient demographics and medical info | → Appointments |
| `Doctors` | Doctor credentials and specializations | → Appointments, → Specializations |
| `Appointments` | Appointment scheduling and management | ← Patients, ← Doctors |
| `Medical_Records` | Patient visit documentation | ← Appointments (1:1) |
| `Bills` | Billing and invoicing | ← Appointments (1:1) |
| `Payments` | Payment tracking | ← Bills |
| `Treatments` | Treatment catalog | ↔ Appointments (M:M) |
| `Medications` | Drug inventory | → Prescriptions |
| `Prescriptions` | Patient prescriptions | ← Appointments, ← Medications |
| `Staff` | Non-doctor staff management | Self-referencing hierarchy |

### Sample Queries

```sql
-- Find all appointments for today
SELECT * FROM AppointmentDetails 
WHERE AppointmentDate = CURDATE();

-- Check overdue bills
SELECT * FROM BillingSummary 
WHERE Balance > 0 AND DueDate < CURDATE();

-- View doctor schedules
SELECT CONCAT(FirstName, ' ', LastName) AS Doctor,
       COUNT(*) AS AppointmentsToday
FROM Doctors d
JOIN Appointments a ON d.DoctorID = a.DoctorID
WHERE a.AppointmentDate = CURDATE()
GROUP BY d.DoctorID;
```

## 🎨 Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

### Relationship Summary
- **One-to-One**: Appointments ↔ Medical_Records, Appointments ↔ Bills
- **One-to-Many**: Doctors → Appointments, Patients → Appointments, Bills → Payments
- **Many-to-Many**: Appointments ↔ Treatments (via Appointment_Treatments junction table)
- **Self-Referencing**: Staff → Staff (supervisor hierarchy)

```
Patients (1) ----< Appointments >---- (1) Doctors
    |                    |                    |
    |                    |                    |
    |              Medical_Records      Specializations
    |                    |                    
    |                   Bills          
    |                    |             
    |                 Payments         
    |                                  
 Prescriptions ---- Medications       
    |                                  
Appointment_Treatments ---- Treatments
                                      
Staff ---- Staff (Self-Reference)
```

### Visual ERD
*For a complete visual ERD, import the SQL file into MySQL Workbench and use:*
- **Database → Reverse Engineer** to generate the ERD automatically
- Or use online tools like [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io) with the schema
